## Youngjoo Kim, Ph.D.
Hi, I am Youngjoo and this is my shared repository. I am interested in asking questions about how things work and how to apply the answers to solving other questions of all kinds. For my Ph.D., these questions were mostly embedded inside complicated multidimensional data sets. I tried approaching these questions by visualizing the data and then applying possible solutions to problems in new fields. During my Ph.D. and M.Eng., these fields were astronomy (aiming to unravel the evolutional history of the Milky Way) and biomedical data (aiming to classify tasks by signals such as EEG, ECG, and human motion data).

Please refer to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youngjoo--kim/) for my full bio.
